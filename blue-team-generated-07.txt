The only thing worse than a 4 than a 7 is a "mental image of a 7-year-old" comment from a 20-year-old. A 7-year-old is someone who is bullied, threatened or left out of class. A 7-year-old is someone who:

Does not speak English

Is bullied on sight

Is forced to wear the same outfit twice

Is forced to wear the same kind of clothing as the opposite sex

Is bullied on sight or sees through the jokes

Is bullied on the go

but the point is, if you ever hit a skip and hit a hdhr and end up in a rhythm game area you're gonna get kinda bored quickly.

no need to brag, just know that for whatever reason we don't like this game a whole lot more than we like beatmap games.

today i'm gonna be honest with you, we don't like beatmap games very much.
we like them for being easy and easy fun.
today i'm gonna be honest with you, we like them for being fairly demanding.
we like them for being fairly demanding of course we do.

- aram,
- price,
- speed
- i played on twitch for 6 hours and broke every game i could possibly make

break every game i could possibly make

speed of play: maybe 5-6 hours maybe

played on a modern pc monitor

no microtransactions

no ads

no sub favours

just plain boring

these are just some of the hdt and hdt i play that arent being improved on

today i was reminded that buying a new pc is a huge financial sacrifice if it's going to add me 10-15x as much as i would have gotten with a previous purchase

i have no interest in upgrading to a next gen pc, just upgrading my already purchased game
====================
The only thing keeping me from playing Final Fantasy is my will and ability. If I'm not 100% in the right mindset and then get tilted towards another game, I won't play that game. That mindset alone is just not fair. "You can't beat me in osu, I can only beat you in osu". Those are absolute brain waves.

I'm not saying STREAMING is the best idea, but when a show nominates osu has a responsibility to respect the artistic integrity of its cast and crew. 

I'm sure the decision will be made in due course, but first let me be clear - I'm not saying @TheBlackCrow should be made TWICE as bad as the guy who shot my best friend, but rather that I believe it is time for the pair to be torn apart as a whole. 

The fact that so many people are still supporting these bullies is unforgivable.

<|startoftext|>I hear people say that the only thing keeping the west european country from falling apart is a lack of education and government reform.

Wholeheartedly this is a lie. The fact of the matter is, we have had a free and fair education for centuries.

And we have had free and fair government for the last 200 years.

No longer a one off "just like us in the west" mindset.

A generation ago, people thought of themselves as being above the law. Now, we know we are not.

Today, we are treated like second class citizens.

No wonder so many in the west despise us.

Today's criminals are coming from all walks of life.

No wonder so many in the west despise us.

I have learned from wearing face masks that the same breath that's been sitting in my nostril has the same smell as if it were sitting in my mouth. This is absolutely NOT true. The same breath has the same smell as if it were sitting in my mouth. This is a direct result of the use of the 'smell the same as it did a decade ago' approach to the production of 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' which I will fully support in the end.
