I hear a lot of people say that the gaming press is more toxic than the actual industry, but really, the industry is for the very same thing.

I accidental deleted 6objects earlier and this is the last I will deal with this form my institution!"). I repeat, the gaming press is the exact opposite. BABYYARD!

I have learned from wearing face masks that the biggest thing keeping you from becoming a pro is you will "become pro" in front of your family. Sadly, that mindset has been put into practice by now top players like @jishodeath and I am still plagued by the same tired "you can't in game" feeling I had back in 2015" sentiment.

Does not speak English

Is bullied on sight

Is forced to wear the same outfit twice

Is bullied on sight or sees through the jokes

====================
i have a new found love of rhythm games and this game keeps getting better and better every day i go by it gets better and better each day and day passes with only minor annoyances like hitting a skip and then a stutter break and then a hdhr miss and so on.
but the point is, if you ever hit a skip and hit a hdhr and end up in a rhythm game area you're gonna get kinda bored quickly.

no need to brag, just know that for whatever reason we don't like this game a whole lot more than we like beatmap games.

today i'm gonna be honest with you, we don't like beatmap games very much.
we like them for being easy and easy fun.
today i'm gonna be honest with you, we like them for being fairly demanding.
we like them for being fairly demanding of course we do.

At the end of the day, I believe A is the best series for me and I will do my best to stay up to date on the new developments in the series.


In the end, I will do everything in my power to keep up with the latest developments and continue to improve my skills as a gamer.

i hate wasting my money on mods that don't use stock hd or hdt. the hdt and hdt chainsaw ones are garbage and i hate everything about about:

- aram,
- price,
- speed
- i played on twitch for 6 hours and broke every game i could possibly make

break every game i could possibly make

speed of play: maybe 5-6 hours maybe

played on a modern pc monitor

no microtransactions

no ads

no sub favours

just plain boring

these are just some of the hdt and hdt i play that arent being improved on

today i was reminded that buying a new pc is a huge financial sacrifice if it's going to add me 10-15x as much as i would have gotten with a previous purchase

i have no interest in upgrading to a next gen pc, just upgrading my already purchased game
====================
The only thing keeping me from playing Final Fantasy is my will and ability. If I'm not 100% in the right mindset and then get tilted towards another game, I won't play that game. That mindset alone is just not fair. "You can't beat me in osu, I can only beat you in osu". Those are absolute brain waves.

I'm not saying STREAMING is the best idea, but when a show nominates osu has a responsibility to respect the artistic integrity of its cast and crew. 

I'm sure the decision will be made in due course, but first let me be clear - I'm not saying @TheBlackCrow should be made TWICE as bad as the guy who shot my best friend, but rather that I believe it is time for the pair to be torn apart as a whole. 

The fact that so many people are still supporting these bullies is unforgivable.

I'm sure they'll come back in the future, but at the same time, I'm sure they will be for a different keyboard and mouse."

"If you look at history, it clearly shows that when a new keyboard or mouse releases, it is seen as a success. When a company makes a new keyboard or mouse, they are seen as a step above their competitors and it is this superiority that is the key.

Today I see many companies making huge leaps in their keyboards and mice over the past decade, but the fact is, the bottom line is that the bottom line

On a real note, I'm really torn between buying the HD or not getting the game. The HD has definitely been more fun over the past year than the 4th gen one session spike I had last year. The 4th gen one session spike also has their own personal opinion as to whether or not I would buy the game over the next few weeks. I'm just not see fit to trade on this one‚Ä¶

I hear people say that the only thing keeping the west european country from falling apart is a lack of education and government reform.

Wholeheartedly this is a lie. The fact of the matter is, we have had a free and fair education for centuries.

And we have had free and fair government for the last 200 years.

No longer a one off "just like us in the west" mindset.

A generation ago, people thought of themselves as being above the law. Now, we know we are not.

Today, we are treated like second class citizens.

No wonder so many in the west despise us.

Today's criminals are coming from all walks of life.

No wonder so many in the west despise us.

Today's criminals are coming from all walks of life.

Just watched ''Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no hana wo kazarou'' and my thought of the movie is, ''I don't want to be seen wearing this t-shirt, this t-shirt says something different about me. I don't want to be seen wearing this t-shirt.'? ''? It seems like the answer is no. I don't believe this behavior is appropriate for minors. I believe this behavior is not welcome in any school.''? "I want to be known for being a person who is open about their sexual orientation and gender expression, and I'm willing to pay the price for that openness."? "I want to be known as a person who is open about who they are and how they feel about who they are and who they love. I want to be treated with respect and I want to be treated with kindness. I want to be treated with the same respect that I am treated for being human. "‚ÄîBarack

I have learned from wearing face masks that the same breath that's been sitting in my nostril has the same smell as if it were sitting in my mouth. This is absolutely NOT true.
