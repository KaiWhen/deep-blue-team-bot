that no one has been born in North Korea with modern dual nationality

that no one has been born in North Korea with severe mental illness

that no one has been born in North Korea with a higher IQ

that North Korea is a better place to live if you're white and you come to North Korea than if you are a poor, crime-ridden, and/or insane lot."

If you look at history, it has shown us how we've changed in this game. Those born in the past 50 years, those born in the future or those born in the past 2 centuries, have a clear line of demarcation. "old" as in "old as in" is not considered modern by most. Those born in the past 2 centuries, those born in the past 2 centuries, have a clear line of demarcation. "We don't live in the past, we live in the future".

I hear a lot of people say that the gaming press is more toxic than the actual industry, but really, the industry is for the very same thing. Gamers are the true victims, the press is the best-suited to tell the difference. "Oops, I deleted my social media account, sorry! I was just unlucky! I accidental deleted 6objects earlier and this is the last I will deal with this form my institution!"). I repeat, the gaming press is the exact opposite. BABYYARD!

I want to completely and honestly lie to you guys, but I know I'll never be able to be your friends again. ''

I have learned from wearing face masks that the biggest thing keeping you from becoming a pro is you will "become pro" in front of your family. Sadly, that mindset has been put into practice by now top players like @jishodeath and I am still plagued by the same tired "you can't in game" feeling I had back in 2015" sentiment.

The only thing worse than a 4 than a 7 is a "mental image of a 7-year-old" comment from a 20-year-old. A 7-year-old is someone who is bullied, threatened or left out of class. A 7-year-old is someone who:

Does not speak English

Is bullied on sight

Is forced to wear the same outfit twice

Is forced to wear the same kind of clothing as the opposite sex

Is bullied on sight or sees through the jokes

Is bullied on the go

On a real note, I'm really fucking pissed off at not enough people like this osu fan fc.
====================

====================
i have a new found love of rhythm games and this game keeps getting better and better every day i go by it gets better and better each day and day passes with only minor annoyances like hitting a skip and then a stutter break and then a hdhr miss and so on.
but the point is, if you ever hit a skip and hit a hdhr and end up in a rhythm game area you're gonna get kinda bored quickly.

no need to brag, just know that for whatever reason we don't like this game a whole lot more than we like beatmap games.

today i'm gonna be honest with you, we don't like beatmap games very much.
we like them for being easy and easy fun.
today i'm gonna be honest with you, we like them for being fairly demanding.
we like them for being fairly demanding of course we do.

we like them for being fairly demanding of course we do.

#16IE, upgrading to vMC

I'm not complaining, 
====================

- started from 0-7th level
- gotten better at laneing with ss and also started from 1st to 10th level
- got better at map control like ss and also started from 1st to 10th level
- got better at map getting and getting
- got better at getting
- got better at getting
- got better at getting
- got better at getting
- got better at getting
- got better at getting
- got better at getting
- got better at getting
- got better at getting
all this and more on my timeline as time permits!

On a real note, I'm not even joking when I say that North Korea's economy is going for literally peanuts right now. The North Korean government is currently jamming us with tax increases, huge spending, and massive famine relief. Let me just say that this is not a good look for me. North Korea is a country, and a famine is a global public health crisis. This kind of rhetoric is completely out of control, and I stand with the millions of people affected by this tragedy."

====================
i hate wasting my money on mods that don't use stock hd or hdt. the hdt and hdt chainsaw ones are garbage and i hate everything about about:

- aram,
- price,
- speed
- i played on twitch for 6 hours and broke every game i could possibly make

break every game i could possibly make

speed of play: maybe 5-6 hours maybe

played on a modern pc monitor

no microtransactions

no ads

no sub favours

just plain boring

these are just some of the hdt and hdt i play that arent being improved on

today i was reminded that buying a new pc is a huge financial sacrifice if it's going to add me 10-15x as much as i would have gotten with a previous purchase

i have no interest in upgrading to a next gen pc, just upgrading my already purchased game
====================
The only thing keeping me from playing Final Fantasy is my will and ability. If I'm not 100% in the right mindset and then get tilted towards another game, I won't play that game. That mindset alone is just not fair. "You can't beat me in osu, I can only beat you in osu". Those are absolute brain waves. 
====================
I need your help!

I'm not saying STREAMING is the best idea, but when a show nominates osu has a responsibility to respect the artistic integrity of its cast and crew. 

I'm sure the decision will be made in due course, but first let me be clear - I'm not saying @TheBlackCrow should be made TWICE as bad as the guy who shot my best friend, but rather that I believe it is time for the pair to be torn apart as a whole. 

The fact that so many people are still supporting these bullies is unforgivable.

To say I'm satisfied with this score is an insult to all gamers, is an insult to all colour people, and is a direct rip off of the Watch Dogs model of a family with 14 year old girls playing video games is ludicrous and offensive to me and all gamers - white, male or female - it doesn't matter - kid, beat up or anything... it just happens to be one of my scores - proud gamer -

I hear people say "my laptop isnt broke, let's go break it' but in fact it is a gaming keyboard and mouse." Well in my humble opinion a gaming mouse and keyboard is exactly what it sounds like.

The key here is that I havent had a single swing/stomach pain, and they're definitely not permanent.

I'm sure they'll come back in the future, but at the same time, I'm sure they will be for a different keyboard and mouse."

— Steve Buscemi

"If you look at history, it clearly shows that when a new keyboard or mouse releases, it is seen as a success. When a company makes a new keyboard or mouse, they are seen as a step above their competitors and it is this superiority that is the key.

Today I see many companies making huge leaps in their keyboards and mice over the past decade, but the fact is, the bottom line is that the bottom line

The kid that talks shit on you on Xbox Live @XempusWasTaken has decided he wants to take a break from simulating the actual thing he does. He wants to focus on improving osu! and enjoying life.

Or tell me Yakusoku, this was done in my head.'... I don't care. It was written for me. It was written for you. ''Sayonara no hana, this was done in my head, I don't like the dialogue, tell me.'... Well, I guess I can blame you.''

I hear people say that the only thing keeping the west european country from falling apart is a lack of education and government reform.

Wholeheartedly this is a lie. The fact of the matter is, we have had a free and fair education for centuries.

And we have had free and fair government for the last 200 years.

No longer a one off "just like us in the west" mindset.

A generation ago, people thought of themselves as being above the law. Now, we know we are not.

Today, we are treated like second class citizens.

No wonder so many in the west despise us.

Today's criminals are coming from all walks of life.

No wonder so many in the west despise us.

Today's criminals are coming from all walks of life.

====================
Just watched ''Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no hana wo kazarou'' and my thought of the movie is, ''I don't want to be seen wearing this t-shirt, this t-shirt says something different about me. I don't want to be seen wearing this t-shirt.'? ''? It seems like the answer is no. I don't believe this behavior is appropriate for minors. I believe this behavior is not welcome in any school.''? "I want to be known for being a person who is open about their sexual orientation and gender expression, and I'm willing to pay the price for that openness."? "I want to be known as a person who is open about who they are and how they feel about who they are and who they love. I want to be treated with respect and I want to be treated with kindness. I want to be treated with the same respect that I am treated for being human. "—Barack

Just watched ''Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no hana wo kazarou' (道讲関节快乐) and it really hit me how different the two stories were. The first was more a story about school and the second was about being a normal person.'

If I get knocked out of a tournament today I want this enormous white elephant sitting next to me. 

He's not even in the tournament, he's just sitting on my couch. White elephants are so iconic in this day and age, why is it that so few people are familiar with them? 
Why does every single nut in the food industry even bother to eat? 
Why is it a building if there's no one at the top of the food chain…

I have learned from wearing face masks that the same breath that's been sitting in my nostril has the same smell as if it were sitting in my mouth. This is absolutely NOT true. The same breath has the same smell as if it were sitting in my mouth. This is a direct result of the use of the 'smell the same as it did a decade ago' approach to the production of 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' which I will fully support in the end.
